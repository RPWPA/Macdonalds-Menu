Used: Factory to get the sandwich Builder.
Used: Composite to add a list of items{ingredients} which I needed in the sandwich.
Used: Builder to build the sandwich I needed.
Used: Decorator to add the fries and cola if needed. 

NOTE: Please note that instead of making each one of the mushroom and pickle slices their class
alone unlike the cheese/bread/onion/sauce, I made a general interface for those 2 and they both implement it and it's called "extra condaments".
